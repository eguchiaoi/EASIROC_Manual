We can construct a tightly integrated detector with monolithic MPPC array. 
However, to cover the large area of the detector, we need to handle large amount of MPPCs. 
MPPCs on the single monolithic MPPS array have different break down voltage and gain, thus it is necessary to adjust the operation voltage for each MPPC.\\
To much these needs, KEK and openIt developed EASIROC board (GN-1101-1,GN-1101-2R) in 2013.\\
This chip has some characteristics listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Readout 32 channels simultaneously
\item Take positive voltage as input, amplifying, shaping output positive voltage
\item Adjust bias voltage by 8 bit (0-4.5 V)
\item Have discriminator in it
\item Set parameters through slow control
\item Cover the dynamics of 160 fC - 320 pC as input charge (this corresponds to 1-2000 p.e. with the assumption that MPPC's gain is $10^6$) 
\end{itemize}

University of Tokyo upgraded the EASIROC for the use of MPPC mass test for WAGASCI experiment and attached the function for scaler and TDC information.
